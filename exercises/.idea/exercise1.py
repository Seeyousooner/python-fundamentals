print('Hello World')

# Can you make a typo that generates an error?
#       Yes I am able to make an error by deleting the "t" in "print"
# Can you make sense of the error message?
#       Yes I can make sense of the error message, The error says that it can't display the message.
# Can you make a typo that doesn't generate an error?
#       Yes I can make a typo..print('Hello WorldP')
# Why do you think it did not make an error?
#       It did not make an error because whatever is in the parantheses is the name of what's being
#       displayed and not the command executing.
